## 📌 Internship Program
**AI & ML Internship**

## 📊 Task Title
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

(Alternative tool explored: Tableau Public – optional)

## 📂 Dataset Used
- Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset  
- Iris Dataset  

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand the dataset by analyzing patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies using statistical analysis and visualizations. This helps in identifying important features and preparing the data for machine learning models.

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Imported and explored the dataset structure
2. Checked dataset shape, column names, and data types
3. Handled missing values (if any)
4. Performed statistical summary using `describe()`
5. Visualized numerical features using histograms
6. Analyzed categorical features using count plots
7. Detected outliers using box plots
8. Created correlation heatmap to study feature relationships
9. Identified important features for prediction
10. Documented insights for each visualization

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Histogram plots for numerical distributions  
- Count plots for categorical features  
- Box plots to detect outliers  
- Correlation heatmap  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Identified distribution patterns of numerical features
- Detected presence of outliers in specific columns
- Observed correlation between important variables
- Understood feature behavior and relationships
- Identified features relevant for model building
